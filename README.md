# Chess in Ruby 

This is my implementation of the classic chess game in Ruby and it is the final project of the Ruby Course on [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project).

At the moment this game is only playable with two players.

Chess is playable in the console. To start run the game via 

```
ruby lib/game.rb
```
Enjoy!
